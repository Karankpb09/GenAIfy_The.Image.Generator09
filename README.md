# GenAIfy â€“ AI Image Generator API

*GenAIfy* is an API built using Node.js that generates images based on user-provided text prompts using AI. This is my first API-based project, aimed at exploring AI integration with backend technologies.

## Features

- Accepts text prompts via API
- Generates AI images using third-party services (like OpenAI, Replicate, etc.)
- RESTful API built with Express.js
- Clean and modular code structure

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios / Fetch (for calling AI services)
- JSON for request/response handling
